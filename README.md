# magicMatrices
a homework from university, about magic matrices generations in a interval of 3 to 10

## What it contains?
The final objective to this repository is to implement three methods to generate magic matrices:  
a method to generate odd order magic matrices;  
a method to generate even order magic matrices with order multiple of 2 and not 4;  
and a method to generate even order magic matrices with order multiple of 4 and not 2.  
  
And implement a basic textual interface in portuguese language

## How it works?
A magic matrix is a square matrix that the sum of all columns, rows and diagonals are the same.    
Exist three types of magic matrix:  Odd, Even divisible by 2 and not 4 (called singly even) and Even divisible only for 4 (called doubly even).   
All the code had been made in C language, and the user have to insert the order of wished matrix.  
Then the magic matrix of the inserted order will be displayed, very simple, but sufficient to the homework.
